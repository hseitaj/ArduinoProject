# ArduinoProject

In this project, we are assembling a 4WD robot that will implement the 4WD and Arm robot to retrieve an object and deliver it to the destination.
When the robot goes to the location to get an object, it should avoid obstacles and follow a line.
To accomplish this we intend to utilize several sensors.
We are going to use a tracking sensor to follow the line and an ultrasonic module to avoid obstacles.
